## 📘 IMDB Sentiment Analysis using NLP

This notebook explores **different approaches** to perform sentiment analysis on the **IMDB movie reviews dataset**, using various **NLP preprocessing techniques** and **machine learning models**.

### 🔍 What’s Inside:

#### 🧼 1. Text Preprocessing
- Normalization, regex cleaning
- Tokenization: word, sentence, subword (BERT-style)
- Stemming & Lemmatization
- Stopword removal
- POS tagging
- Handling URLs, emojis, and abbreviations

#### 📊 2. Text Representation & Embedding
- One-Hot Encoding  
- Bag of Words (BoW)  
- N-Grams  
- TF-IDF  
- Word2Vec (intro only)  
- GloVe embeddings  
- Pretrained vs custom embeddings  

#### 🧠 3. Sentiment Analysis Models
- **BoW + TF-IDF + Logistic Regression**  
- **Pretrained GloVe + LSTM Neural Network**

Each model is trained and evaluated with metrics and training curves to compare their performance.
